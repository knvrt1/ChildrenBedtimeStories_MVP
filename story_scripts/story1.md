# The Brave Little Sparrow

**Blurb:** A short tale about kindness and courage for sleepy kids. (~2–3 minutes)

Once upon a time, in a small green garden, there lived a little sparrow named Chikki. Chikki loved to sing from the top of the bamboo every morning. One hot day, Chikki saw a thirsty ant struggling to climb a leaf. The ant had lost its way and could not find water.

Chikki flew down, gave the ant a drop of water from a leaf, and reminded the ant of the cool pond near the big tree. The ant was grateful and promised to help Chikki when needed.

A few days later, a strong wind knocked Chikki’s home out of the bamboo. Chikki could not rebuild alone. The ant and many tiny friends came together and helped carry soft leaves and twigs. They rebuilt Chikki’s nest even stronger.

Chikki learned that being kind makes friends who help in return. That night, Chikki sang the sweetest song, and everyone in the garden slept peacefully.

**Goodnight.**
