# The Wise Banyan Tree

**Blurb:** A gentle story about patience, listening, and friendship. (~2–4 minutes)

Long ago, on the edge of a small village, grew a grand banyan tree. Children played under its shade and birds nested in its branches. The banyan tree listened to everyone's stories — it never hurried and it never forgot.

One little boy named Aarav wanted everything quickly. He planted a tiny seed and expected it to grow into a big tree by morning. He grew frustrated when days passed and the seed stayed small.

The wise banyan bent a low branch and whispered, "Little things grow quietly. Give them love, water, and time." Aarav watered the seed every day and sat patiently under the banyan to read.

Weeks turned into months; the seed sprouted, then grew leaves. Aarav learned to wait and care. Years later, a small sapling grew into a healthy young tree. Aarav would tell other children: "The banyan taught me patience — good things grow with time."

As dusk fell, the banyan swayed and hummed a lullaby. The village children yawned and fell asleep with dreams full of trees and gentle winds.

**Goodnight.**
